    Environment protocol function will be removed from all controllers once other persistent data is implemented.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Custom UI Components ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

i. RoundButton
    - Template class for all round buttons. Generates rounded edges by making the corner radius 1/2 of the button's height. The height can be provided programmatically or in storyboard.
    - If a button is given a background color of 'Default' the button will generate a border to match the color of its title property.
    - Class originally utilized @IBDesignable, however this seem to cause issues while working with storyboard.

ii. UnderlinedTextField
    - Template subclass of UITextField that adds a line under the text field
    - The color of the line, placeholder text color, etc. are determined at runtime to match the 'Text Color' property provided in storyboard.




A. User
    - The delete vehicle/payment methods can only be accessed by clicking on a vehicle/paymentMethod cell - because of this it can be force unwrapped.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Controllers ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I. FirstVC
    - Controller for initial view controller that gives potential ways to log in.
    - Firebase may allow for login/authentication through facebook/google/etc.
    
II. LoginVC
    -

III. CreateAccountVC
    - The create account page is composed of multiple stack views, with only one visible at a time.
    - Each time 'Next' is pressed, a switch is triggered to see which stack is visible. It is removed and the next stack is displayed.
    
    ** May want to consider changing the multiple stacks to a collectionView **
    
IV. ForgotPassword VC
    -
    
V. HomepageVC
    -

VI. MenuTVC
    - Table view controller for the menu, uses SideMenu pod
    - Generates a table using the MenuProfile and MenuButton tableViewCell XIB files.
    
        - MenuProfileTableViewCell:
            - Displays information unique to the user such as their name and their rating.
            - The cell itself is not selectable. The only destination segue connected to this cell is through the 'See Reviews' button.
            
        - MenuButtonTableViewCell:
            - Reused and populated with the Strings found in the menuItems array.
            - Depending on the provided string, the imageView is updated with the appropriate image.
            - When one of these cells are clicked, the selected row is used to find the name of the button in the menuItems array. It then uses the name to search the menuButtonDestinations dictionary and find the corresponding segue. The segue is passed through the delegate and executed in the HomepageVC
