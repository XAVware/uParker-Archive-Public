1. Learn how to pass views correctly. HeaderView currently takes an optional image as AnyView. SettingsButton takes the destination as AnyView. Ideally the content will be included as a closure - look into how Apple wrote their VStack.

2. Adjust all button heights based on size of screen with global constant

3. Correct Divider line above tab view

4. Can I make geometry reader a constant if I'm only allowing portrait mode?
